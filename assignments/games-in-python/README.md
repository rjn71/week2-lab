## 🎯 Objective

Build the classic Hangman word-guessing game using Python to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Implement Core Game Logic

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list of words
- Accept single letter guesses from the user
- Display current progress using underscores for unrevealed letters (e.g., `_ _ _ l e`)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- Handle invalid input (non-letters, repeated guesses)


### 🛠️ Game Flow and User Experience

#### Description
Implement the complete game flow with win/lose conditions and user-friendly messages.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- End the game when the word is completely guessed (win condition)
- End the game when attempts are exhausted (lose condition)
- Display appropriate win or lose messages
- Show the complete word at the end of the game
- Allow the player to start a new game
